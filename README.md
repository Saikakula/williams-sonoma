## Features added

1. **Atomic Design:** Atom design principles have been used to make the code more reusable and composable. More about that can be read here. [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design)
2. **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and adaptive to cater to all sort of viewports. The product listing section will have a three-column layout for viewports having a width of more than 990px. And for smaller devices, it will adjust according to the screen width.
3. **Search Bar:** Search bar is functional and can be used to search specific products in the products list.
4. **Product Card Carousel:** The product card has a carousel that will autoplay the product images in sequence on hover. And to go to a specific image, Carousel navigation provided on the bottom of the card can be used.
